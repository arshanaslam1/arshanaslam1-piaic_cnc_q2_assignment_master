        &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Why it's special:</strong> Robby incorporates an interactive experience into his portfolio.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>What it's about:</strong> If you associate portfolios with a dry list of facts, this portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a novel way of displayin what otherwise was dry information - he laid out his portfolio site as a video game that the visitor can acutally play. This &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; incredibly fun interactive design portfolio will make you scroll.
